This is a repo for the various openSCAD and STL files for a gift I created for my girlfriend and I's 5th anniversary.

The gift is a cylindrical box with a rotating bottom. As the bottom is rotated, two things happen: 
1. an internal platform lowers to reveal five hearts on axels
2. each of the hearts spin around its vertical axis

The overall mechanism is similar to a chapstick, but with the addition of some gearing. 

To see the box in action, check out ![this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LECbsYAFou4)

This image shows all the parts assembled (in Blender) and provides a pretty good overview of how it works.

Special thanks to the creators of the gear and thread libraries for openSCAD, without which this wouldn't have been possible.
